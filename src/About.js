        Huge numbers exotic and endangered animals are victim to illegal animal
        trading each year and our group has decided to create a website that
        collects the statistics and facts about such animals. We have chosen 5
        animals to focus on, they are the following: Tigers, Elephants, Bears,
        Rinos, Pangolins. The main purpose of this website is to raise awareness
        about this issue. we all collaborated in the creation of this website
        and each chose roles that will be challenging for us. Celia focused on
        coding the website and creating a web crawler of collect the
        information, improving her coding skills. Jessica and Elyse created
        artworks to decorate this website and improved their artistic skills.
